   <p>Microsoft Flight Simulator (colloquially known as Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020) is a flight simulator developed by Asobo Studio and published by Xbox Game Studios for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One. It was released on August 18, 2020 for Microsoft Windows. It is the eleventh major entry in the Microsoft Flight Simulator series, preceded by Flight Simulator X.
      Flight Simulator simulates the entire Earth using textures and topographical data from Bing Maps. Three-dimensional representations of the world's features, such as terrain, trees, grass, buildings, and water are generated by Microsoft Azure technology. Through the use of the Azure cloud to render visuals, enhance visual fidelity, and simulate real-world data and effects, as well as calculate physics, the title has been viewed as the culmination of Microsoft's "power of the cloud" mantra. Some players received the alpha version as part of the game's Insider program. On July 13, 2020, Microsoft opened up preorders, and the PC version became available on August 18, 2020.
